	[email from CGIAR-CSI]
	Thanks for your interest in the CGIAR-CSI SRTM v4.1 dataset!

	If you're up to download one big package file with all the tiles (27 GB), try:
	https://goo.gl/T9YY2W (Google Drive)

	Alternatively (preferred by many, in fact), you can download by tile at:
	http://data.cgiar-csi.org/srtm/tiles

	* User name: data_public
	* Password: GDdci

	From there, you can use a mutiple-file downloader (e.g., Firefox + DownloadThemAll! works pretty well) to batch download the files. Let me know if you experience any difficulty downloading the data file.

	Good luck!

===================================================================================================
	note adf: best to do it from https://goo.gl/T9YY2W (Google Drive). 
	[downloading all, with Firefox + DownloadThemAll, or with my little script 
	wget-srtm-all-bulk.sh, chokes sometimes, so not all files will be there!]
	afterwards: 
		unzip SRTMv4.1.zip -d /media/alaindef/andersan/
		in andersan: unzip '*.zip'

	note 2: srtm_25_13.asc may be faulty. unzip reported "bad CRC".
